> Enhanced Google community nodes for your [n8n](https://n8n.io/) workflows

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use [Google actions](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) with
service account credentials in your n8n workflows. Although the authentication method recommended by n8n is OAuth2, this
is not suitable in an environment where no user interaction is intended.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
